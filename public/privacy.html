      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>
        I do not collect any information about your calendars, the events on your calendars, or your class
        schedule.  The only information I collect is anonymized basic usage information via Google Analytics.
    </p>

    <h2>No calendar data collected</h2>
    <p>
        All aspects of reading and exporting your class schedule happens inside your web browser, on your computer.
        This website does NOT read, collect, or store events from Google Calendar, nor does it send class schedules
        anywhere except Google Calendar.  Permission to read events from Google Calendar are not necessary for the site
        to function, but Google bundles them with the permission to add events.
    </p>
    <p>
        For proof of the above, you are invited to visit the codebase at
        <a href="https://github.com/smhsu/webstacToCal">https://github.com/smhsu/webstacToCal</a>.

    <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
    <p>
        This website uses Google Analytics, which sets a browser cookie to collect the following anonymized information:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2016/06/22/how-does-google-analytics-collect-information/">Basic
            usage stats</a>, such as how long you were on the site, and your web browser version.</li>
        <li>Whether class/final parsing was successful (a pure yes-no)</li>
        <li>The number of events added</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I use this information to determine how many users visit (so I know if it is worth it to keep updating the site,
        haha), to understand how users are interacting with the site, and to give me an early warning if class parsing
        suddenly starts failing.
    </p>
